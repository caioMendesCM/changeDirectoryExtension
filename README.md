## Features

This extension allows you to quickly and easily change the currently open folder in VSCode using the keyboard.
You can do this by using the command *Change Directory* (or *cd* for quick access) in the VSCode command palette or by pressing *Alt+D* on your keyboard when VSCode is open.

When you have selected the folder you want, simply choose the "." option from the list, and your VSCode will reload in that folder. Unfortunately, it is not possible to change the folder without reloading VSCode.
